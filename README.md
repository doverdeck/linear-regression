# linear-regression
In this lab I graphed EPS in relation to the Gross Profit of a stock for 10 different stocks. As shown by the linear regression there was some correlation between the increase in the Earnings per Stock to the gross profit. A linear regression is more misleading than a bell curve in this situation as the fractional value of an EPS lead to a higher profit margin on the scatter plot than a greater EPS, which is what is supposed to occur. However, due to the negative values on the EPS graph it counterbalanced the lower gross profit margin, leading to the graph you see in the file. It also showed how not all metrics are entirely reliable as EPS might not always indicate a higher gross profit as some companies might be larger and have a high gross profit but not always have a better EPS (better EPS's are low).
